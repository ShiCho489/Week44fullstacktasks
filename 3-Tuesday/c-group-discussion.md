- How is require() different from import()?
One of the major differences between require() and import() is that require() can be called from anywhere inside the program whereas import() cannot be called conditionally, it always runs at the beginning of the file. To use the require() statement, a module must be saved with . js extension as opposed to .
- How do you define custom scripts in `package.json`?
"scripts": {
    "script1": "node script1.js"
}
- Explain the HTTP Request / Response cycle.

The Server reads the Request. It knows how to read it because it is formatted as an HTTP Request.
The Server generates an HTTP Response to that Request.
The server hands the Response off to their ISP and it goes through the internet to arrive at your computer.
Your browser reads the Response. It knows how to read it because it is formatted as an HTTP Response.
- What are TCP Ports and Why Are They Important?
Ports are numbered and used as global standards to identify specific processes or types of network services.

Much like before shipping something to a foreign country, you'd agree where you'd be shipping out of and where you'd have it arriving, TCP ports allow for standardized communication between devices.
